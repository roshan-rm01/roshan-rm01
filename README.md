🐍 Python and Java are probably my two favourite languages to work with but I also work with PHP. 💻 I'm also a big fan of web development, where the Django framework is my go-to framework for creating web apps and APIs. With Python, I'm obsessed with automation hence why I like to use the libraries SpaCy, BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, Xlwings and Selenium. 📈 In terms of learning new things, I always wanted to learn Cython and work on ML/Blockchain related projects. 🥇 My projects include creating a stock market simulator using Java and developing mobile games using Godot.
