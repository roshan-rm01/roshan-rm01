* 👋 Hi I'm @roshan-rm01, I work mostly with Python, Java and the Django framework. Other languages I use to a lesser extent are JavaScript, PHP, HTML/CSS and SQL for database handling.
* 🍎 Python is probably my favourite language while Java is a close second.
* 🐍 The Python libraries I work with mostly are BeautifulSoup, SpaCy, NumPy, Scrapy, Xlwings and Selenium
* 🧠 I am eager to learn different languages like GoLang and Cython while also eager to work on Python (ML) or Java related projects
* 🥇 My projects include creating web apps, web scraping, developing bots, natural language processing applications and creating cool niche programs
